# Vehicle Dashboard with Map and Control Features

This project is a web-based **Vehicle Dashboard** for an autonomous vehicle with features to control speed, gears, brake, and steering, along with real-time vehicle location tracking on a map.

## Features
- **Speed Control**: Increase or decrease vehicle speed.
- **Gear Control**: Switch between Neutral (N), Forward (F), and Reverse (R) gears.
- **Brake Control**: Apply or remove brake using buttons.
- **Steering Control**: Rotate the steering wheel left or right with visual feedback on the rotation angle.
- **Live Map Tracking**: Real-time vehicle location displayed on a map using Leaflet.js.
- **Firebase Integration**: Vehicle data is stored and retrieved from a Firebase Realtime Database.
